## About Red Stream Lollipop
**Red Stream Lollipop** provide an easy way to connect to Redis Master/Slave or to Redis Cluster (comming soon).

When you want to connect to Redis you must check if your library support Redis mode. For example [php-redis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) don't provide support of master/slave. With **Red Stream Lollipop** you can connect you PHP application to Redis master/slave just by giving **Red Stream Lollipop** ip-port.
